    Experts in the electricity sector have emphasized that Nigeria might not be prepared to implement smart metering for all its electricity customers due to the absence of much-needed communications infrastructure. <br/>  <br/>
    However, mass metering via the use of regular meters is gaining some ground.  <br/>  <br/>
    The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) acknowledged significant improvement in Nigeria’s metering and information technology infrastructure in its 2022 Market Competition Report compared to the status as of 2013. <br/>  <br/>
    Despite this progress, the full deployment of the required technology is an ongoing process, at varying stages of implementation within both the wholesale and retail markets. <br/>  <br/>
    Consequently, Nigeria is not yet fully equipped to embrace 100% smart metering. <br/>  <br/>
    A source from one of the country’s distribution companies (DisCos) told Nairametrics that the electricity sector in Nigeria is far from implementing smart meters universally in households and businesses. <br/>  <br/>
    The reason behind this is that local manufacturers believe they should have a direct role in the distribution of smart meters to the general population. <br/>  <br/>
    However, the source highlighted that smart meters manufactured in Nigeria lack certain features necessary to address specific challenges within the electricity sector. <br/>  <br/>
    Additionally, achieving 100% smart metering adoption in the country is contingent upon having a smart national grid, which is not currently a primary focus of the sector because there are so many other immediate issues that the sector needs to tackle first. <br/>  <br/>
    This stance is also echoed in an October 2023 insight report from the Energy Markets and Rates Consulting (EMRC) Limited, which stated that smart meters, substations, and appliances are some of the fundamentals of a smart grid. <br/>  <br/>
    The EMRC report stated that smart grids can track the operations of systems connected to the grid as well as user preferences for consuming electricity while also providing real-time data on all energy events. <br/>  <br/>

    <strong className='text-lg'>Knowing the difference between smart and regular meters</strong> <br/>  <br/>
    It is crucial to emphasize that the key distinction between regular meters and smart meters lies in the communication capabilities of the latter. <br/>  <br/>
    Smart meters possess the ability to communicate through a dedicated communication module, connecting to a remote backend system. <br/>  <br/>
    This facilitates the remote and real-time reading of meter data by the utility (DisCo) and allows remote disconnection without requiring a physical visit to the meter. <br/>  <br/>
    The evolution of smart metering technology has advanced beyond basic remote meter reading through AMI/AMR technologies to encompass IoT (Internet of Things)-based meters and devices. <br/>  <br/>
    These advanced systems can not only read meter data but also monitor the health of the utility’s network. Odion Omonfoman, the Managing Director of New Hampshire Capital Limited, shared insights with Nairametrics, stating that the current metering specifications outlined by NERC for smart meters focus on those utilizing 4G technology within the MAP and NMMP schemes. <br/>  <br/>

    <strong className='text-lg'>Smart meters need backend communications infrastructure</strong> <br/>  <br/>
    However, despite the intelligence of these meters, equipped with GPRS-based communication modems, a significant portion of meters manufactured in Nigeria face limitations in remote communication due to insufficient network communication infrastructure. Omonfoman further highlighted that Nigerian meter manufacturers locally assemble both regular and smart meters, underscoring the country’s adequate capacity for smart meter assembly.  <br/>  <br/>
    Nevertheless, he emphasized that deploying smart meters without the necessary communication infrastructure is an inefficient use of capital by distribution companies (DisCos). Ultimately, this inefficiency leads to higher electricity tariffs for consumers.  <br/>  <br/>
    Consequently, a collaboration between NERC and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) is essential to establish a standardized Nigerian smart meter communication protocol or a dedicated communication frequency exclusively for smart metering devices.  <br/>  <br/>
    He said: <br /> <br />
    <li className="ml-4">
      “Aside from the challenges with the communication infrastructure which
      are outside the scope of DisCos or NERC to manage, there are other
      challenges. For instance, where these meters can be read remotely, many
      DisCos do not have the right technical analytics to analyze and
      optimally utilize the meter data remotely collected from the meters.”
    </li>
    <br />
    Shola Ogunniyi, the Managing Director of Hacom Energy Limited, emphasized
    the significance of smart metering in the energy sector. <br /> <br />
    He said it enables real-time monitoring and communication of electricity
    usage, offering consumers detailed insights and aiding utilities’
    inefficient resource management. Ogunniyi outlined key advantages,
    including enhanced energy efficiency, reduced wastage, and empowering
    consumers to make informed decisions about their consumption patterns.
    <br />
    He said: <br /> <br />
    <li className="ml-4">
      “As a consumer, smart metering allows me to monitor my electricity
      usage, recharge my meters remotely, and receive timely recharge
      reminders. Smart meters expedite the detection of illegal connections
      and aid in revenue loss monitoring.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li className="ml-4">
      “Despite progress by Discos, Meter Asset Providers (MAP), and the
      Federal government’s National Mass Metering Program (NMMP) in narrowing
      the metering gap in Nigeria, the country has not fully harnessed the
      potential benefits of smart metering.”
    </li>
    <br />
    Ogunniyi added that hurdles like low consumer purchasing power, telecom
    infrastructure limits, as noted by Omonfoman, and the recent NMMP 2.0
    Project deadlock due to local meter manufacturers’ concerns may hinder
    broad adoption. <br /> <br />
    <strong className="text-lg">
      Metering data as of Q1/2023
    </strong> <br /> <br />
    On the other hand, the adoption of regular meters in the country is on the
    rise. In the Q1/2023 Electricity Market Report from NERC, it was stated
    that a total of 171,107 meters were installed between January and March
    2023, representing an increase of 6,495 installations (3.95%) compared to
    the 164,612 meters installed in Q4/2022. <br /> <br />
    The new installations resulted in a 1.06 percentage point (pp) increase in
    net end-user metering rate in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry
    (NESI) between Q4/2022 (42.25%) and Q1/2023 (43.31%). <br /> <br />
    The report also noted that 158,634 meters were installed under the Meter
    Asset Provider (MAP) intervention while 9,931 meters were installed under
    the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) scheme. <br /> <br />
    <strong className="text-lg">
      A lack of smart metering can exacerbate sector challenges
    </strong>
    <br /> <br />
    Advocating for nationwide smart metering in Nigeria, Ogunniyi stressed the
    need to expedite its implementation. He emphasized that not adopting smart
    meters in the country’s electricity sector could have significant
    implications.
    <br /> <br />
    This includes inefficient resource allocation due to challenges in
    predicting and responding to demand fluctuations accurately. Such
    inefficiencies may lead to overloads during peak hours and
    under-utilization during off-peak periods.
    <br /> <br />
    Moreover, the absence of real-time monitoring makes it difficult to
    promptly identify and address issues like power theft or technical faults,
    potentially resulting in revenue losses and compromised grid stability.
    <br /> <br />
    Overall, the lack of smart metering could impede the sector’s progress
    towards a more reliable, sustainable, and consumer-centric energy
    landscape.
    <br /> <br />
    Ogunniyi further added that smart metering enhances electricity
    accessibility as Discos can plan based on consumption patterns and make
    informed return on investment (ROI) projections to enhance investments in
    power generation and distribution. Omonfoman echoed this viewpoint,
    affirming that the advantages of smart metering adoption for DisCos are
    multifaceted.
    <br /> <br />
    These include reduced operating costs, diminished commercial and
    collection losses, streamlined energy audits, and real-time tariff
    management. However, he emphasized that despite the benefits, smart
    metering entails substantial initial and recurring expenses.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong className="text-lg">
      Cost benefit analysis should be done before mass smart metering
    </strong>
    <br /> <br />
    According to Omonfoman, DisCos should conduct a thorough cost-benefit
    analysis before implementing smart metering solutions to ensure they can
    realize the benefits it offers. In the long run, it could be financially
    demanding for DisCos, involving significant upfront capital and recurring
    costs for both smart meters and backend meter data infrastructure. <br />
    <br />
    Also, the prevalent communication challenges need to be addressed. <br />
    <br />
    As Omonfoman succinctly puts it; <br /> <br />
    <li className="ml-4">
      “from a cost versus benefit perspective, I do not think it is practical
      or prudent to adopt 100% smart metering in Nigeria because the costs for
      100% smart meter roll-out for any DisCo far outweighs any benefits to
      the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI).”

    (NERC) announced a revised cost structure for the purchase of meters under
    the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) program. <br /> <br />
    Notably, the new pricing scheme excludes Value Added Tax (VAT).
    <br /> <br />
    The cost of single-phase meters has been raised from N58,661.69 to
    N81,975.16, while the price for three-phase meters has jumped from
    N109,684.36 to N143,836.10. <br /> <br />
    According to NERC, this price adjustment is authorized by Section 226 of
    the Electricity Act 2023 and Section 8(1) of the MAP & NMMP 2021
    regulations.
    <br /> <br />
    These legislative frameworks empower the Commission to regulate and set
    the pricing for both single-phase and three-phase meters distributed by
    MAPs, taking into account all relevant costs and warranties. <br /> <br />
    NERC explained that the adjustment was made in response to changes in
    foreign exchange rates. The objective is to avoid potential shortages of
    meters, in line with the Commission’s commitment to phasing out estimated
    billing practices.
    <br /> <br />
    NERC emphasized that a significant portion of the components used in meter
    production is imported, making their costs highly susceptible to
    fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. <br /> <br />
    To accommodate the rising dollar rates, NERC approved the price
    modification.
    <br /> <br />
    This is aimed at ensuring that Meter Asset Providers can recover the
    reasonable costs associated with meter procurement and maintenance. At the
    same time,
    <br /> <br />
    NERC is committed to upholding a pricing framework that guarantees a
    sustainable return on investment (ROI) for MAPs. <br /> <br />
    This comprehensive price adjustment aims to address several challenges
    simultaneously.
    <br /> <br />
    First, it mitigates the risk of meter shortages, which would exacerbate
    the already problematic issue of estimated billing.
    <br /> <br />
    Second, it provides a more financially sustainable environment for MAPs,
    which are pivotal players in the electricity supply chain.
    <br /> <br />
    Lastly, it accommodates the realities of a volatile foreign exchange
    market, ensuring that meter pricing reflects true operational costs.
    <br /> <br />
    However, not everyone is on board with NERC’s lofty plans
    <br /> <br />
    <strong className="text-lg"> Consumer perspective</strong> <br /> <br />
    Reacting to the increase in meter prices, Dozie Igweilo, the Founder of
    QuadLoop, a circular economy startup based in Lagos, told Nairametrics
    that he holds skepticism regarding the anticipated surge in meter
    purchases following this price review. <br /> <br />
    His belief stems from the stark reality that a considerable portion of the
    populace struggles to afford these meters. <br /> <br />
    Thus, many Nigerians are likely to perceive the updated prices as
    exorbitant, potentially labelling it as an exploitation of their financial
    constraints. He said: <br /> <br />
    <li className="ml-4">
      “In examining the renewable energy sector, it becomes evident that the
      pace of adopting sustainable solutions within the nation is notably
      sluggish, primarily due to the financial aspect. The impediment lies in
      the cost factor; a significant portion of the population finds it
      challenging to invest in these beneficial solutions, irrespective of
      their potential to significantly benefit the overall populace.”
    </li>
    <br /> an Akwa Ibom resident told Nairametrics that the prevailing
    hardship in the country is the primary barrier preventing people from
    making purchases. He however noted that even if the cost surges to
    N200,000, individuals will willingly opt for it over enduring exorbitant
    estimated bills from Port Harcourt Distribution Company (DisCo). <br />
    <br />
    He said: <br /> <br />
    “PH DisCo is often regarded as an unscrupulous entity, causing immense
    financial strain and even premature deaths due to the stress it inflicts.
    For instance, in Ibesikpo B, Akwa Ibom State, the highest energy cap for
    non-metered customers stands at 245. <br /> <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “However, PHED staff (often perceived as opportunistic) intentionally
      bill at 425, exploiting the lack of knowledge among the populace
      regarding their actual energy cap. This revelation surfaced after
      analyzing a post by Nairametrics, unmasking years of exploitation
      targeting the impoverished.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “People are willing to liquidate their assets to procure a meter. If
      they delay for another year, their debts could skyrocket by
      N150,000-N200,000, since PH DisCo manipulates the energy cap. Frankly,
      this government appears more burdensome than its predecessors.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “They show concern but impose steep prices, contrary to market rates.
      Even reputable platforms sell quality meters for N8,000-N13,000, starkly
      contrasting the new N81,000 price. Anticipating positive change?
      Doubtful!
    </li>
    <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “PH DisCo adds to the burden, inflating the price to N81,000. I bought
      mine to escape exorbitant bills. We are in an era where the government
      exploits the vulnerable, a departure from past hopes for the public
      good.”
    </li>
    <br />
    Shola Ogunniyi, the Managing Director at Hacom Energy Limited told
    Nairametrics that since the deregulation of the FX rates, the landing cost
    of meters and other ancillary fees have surged above the NERC regulated
    prices. <br /> <br />
    Consequently, the price increase for single and three-phase meters is
    inevitable, however, the price increase is further reducing the ability of
    consumers to purchase meters. <br /> <br />
    He said: <br /> <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “It is unfortunate because while the country is struggling to close the
      over 7 million metering gap a weaker currency and lower purchasing power
      is hampering the progress recorded. If we look at the metering ratio in
      the country, we will observe that only DisCos in the South and Abuja
      Disco are recording good numbers in their MAP projects.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “Most Northern DisCos are struggling to meter their customers because of
      the higher poverty index in the north. While it is understandable that
      the global economies are experiencing higher inflation, Nigeria is also
      trying to prune overhead costs and move Nigerians and the Nigerian
      economy from all forms of government subsidy or intervention.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “It is very important to note that in reality, a large percentage of the
      country cannot afford to compete with international prices of life
      support items like meters and electricity because of the Naira-Dollar
      parity. In summary, in an import-dependent country like Nigeria, a
      weaker Naira always translates to lower purchasing power and emphasizes
      the need for government support or waivers on major essential
      commodities which include electricity meters.

    Meanwhile, Geoffrey Kunda, a therapist, told Nairametrics that Nigerians
    have no option but to purchase the meters at the new prices because the
    country is in a state of helplessness. He said: <br /> <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “We find ourselves in a state of utter helplessness, where the
      collective will of the masses has been deeply fractured. The pertinent
      question to ponder is: what alternatives are available to the people in
      this predicament? In the absence of viable options, even with the
      escalated pricing, the populace finds itself constrained from expressing
      dissent and is compelled to proceed with procuring the meters as a
      proactive measure to avert potential challenges.”

    <strong className="text-lg">
      Industry perspective: MAP activities had already ceased in some areas
    </strong>
    <br /> <br />
    A source within NERC told Nairametrics that the review was necessary
    because of the current economic conditions of the country coupled with the
    foreign exchange (FX) issues that have increased costs for metering
    stakeholders. <br /> <br />
    He stated further that the latest inflation figure – 25.80%, according to
    the latest consumer price index (CPI) data released by the National Bureau
    of Statistics (NBS), makes the price review even more justified. <br />
    <br />
    The source said: <br /> <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “NERC had no choice but to review the prices, the meter manufacturers
      and other stakeholders are also a part of the general populace and are
      running a business where they expect to make a return on the funds spent
      to run the business. The inflation rate, increased logistics costs, and
      the foreign exchange issues in the country affect their business too.”
    </li>
    <br />
    Echoing this sentiment, Odion Omonfoman, the Chief Executive Officer of
    New Hampshire Capital Limited told Nairametrics that the meter price
    review was inevitable and perhaps unduly delayed by the regulator, based
    on the MAP Regulations issued in 2018. <br /> <br />
    According to Omonfoman, the delay by the regulator in reviewing the meter
    prices led to a lot of MAPs and meter manufacturers stopping meter
    procurement, production, and installation for customers who had made
    payments for their meters. He said: <br /> <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “Given the floating of the Naira and other macroeconomic factors, the
      Regulator had no choice but to finally review the meter prices. If the
      prices had not been reviewed, all metering activities under the MAP
      scheme would have ceased, as it was no longer economically and
      commercially viable for MAPs and meter manufacturers to continue to
      meter customers at the old meter prices.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “Unfortunately, customers who desire to be metered under the MAP scheme
      would have to find a way to buy the meter at the new prices.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “This is because there is a looming tariff increase within the next 3
      months, which would mean they may continue to suffer higher electricity
      bills and underestimated billing practices. Besides, if the FX situation
      worsens, the meter prices will go even higher.”
    </li>
    <br />
    <strong className="text-lg"> A possible way out </strong> <br />
    While addressing the current downturn of the Nigerian economy in relation
    to the affordability of prepaid meters by the general populace, Omonfoman
    suggested that to help customers access the meters at the new prices,
    distribution companies (DisCos) and MAPs can devise a payment plan where
    customers can pay for the meters under an instalment basis. <br /> <br />
    He said: <br /> <br />
    <li className="ml-4 list-[square]">
      “Perhaps a 2 to 6-month payment plan for customers who may not have the
      entire capital. Banks can provide financing or help DisCos and MAPs
      structure such financing for electricity customers to pay for meters.”

    our day to day living. Just like the rules of governing building varies
    from place to place so also the rules set by utility companies like
    Power, Water or Gas Distribution Companies also varies. <br /> <br />
    To enable these utilities, provide their services they must be able to
    meter the volume of utility they have supplied to us. It could be in
    kilowatts Hour (kWh) for electricity, cubic meter per seconds/liters for
    second for Water or cubic meters for Gas. The most important and common
    term across all these utilities are meters. <br /> <br />
    The Distribution company and/or supplier may choose to meter you
    Postpaid, meaning you first use, and a bill is sent later or Prepaid,
    you must have paid before service is consumed. Unfortunately, utilities
    are running away from Postpaid billing methods and focusing more on the
    prepaid method because postpaid encourages customers to become debtors.

    , you will see Disco Nigeria are unable to pay their bills to Generation
    Companies largely because of unmetered or postpaid metering issues.
    Consequently, they are looking for innovative ways to reduce customers
    debt in the present and in the future. <br /> <br />
    To properly understand, the need for sub-metering, let’s considers an
    electricity billing system as a utility example. <br /> <br />
    Once a property has about 10 occupants or more or difficult to access
    areas in the compound, Disco sees these as a potential debt trap,
    illegal connection haven and multiple bypass cases. To prevent these
    isseus form occurring they enforce the property owner to get a Maximum
    Demand (MD) Meter and in some cases, they are also required to get a
    transformer. <br /> <br />
    After installtion, they have meter the transformer or main service wire
    at source, with this sorted Discos have limited worry over revenue loss.
    However, once they meter at the power source, what happens to the
    individual customers in the property? <br /> <br />
    <p className="text-center font-semibold text-lg">
      Essentially, this brings about the term – Submetering.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p className="font-semibold text-md">
      What then is Submetering or subsidiary meter?
    </p>
    It is a meter that enables the property owners, landlord, and facility
    manager to monitor the electricity, gas or water consumed independently
    by a single customer. They are not sold by the Disco but approved for
    sale by the relevant regulatory agencies. <br /> <br />
    Each area to be measured must have its own sub-meter, and it is fitted
    to measure what was consumed by each individual consumer. <br /> <br />
    Submetering can be used in multiple scenarios like: markets, backyard
    rentals, estates, shopping complexes, Disco franchisees, boys quarters
    flats, student accommodation, vacation rentals, business parks,
    apartment blocks, complexes, shops in hotels and filling stations.
    <br /> <br />
    <p className="font-semibold text-md">How it work?</p>
    The MD meter from the DISCO, records the total utility consumed for the
    entire property, while the sub-meter only records a portion of the
    consumption. Ideally in the individual sub-metered consumer. <br />
    <br />
    This means that total sum of consummation in all the sub-meters but be
    less than or equal to the bill from the Disco based on the MD meter’s
    reading. <br /> <br />
    The MD meters can be postpaid or prepaid, but majority of the installed
    MDs are postpaid. The Discos comes once at the end of each month to
    measure what was consumed and send a bill a week later. <br /> <br />

      Benefits of prepaid/postpaid sub-metering in properties?
    </p>
    It has been confirmed that property owners/managers enjoy a lot of
    benefits for using submeters and have been a tool that helps solve a
    love of challenges, some of obvious benefits in a few days of
    installation include:
    <br />
    <br />
    Allowing for reliable and accurate utility management for commercial and
    residential properties. Minimizing admin workloads. Improving
    transparency, customer engagement and saves you money. Property
    owners/managers receive payments for their utilities upfront in prepaid
    scenarios and promotes revenue assurance. Reduce the possibility of
    energy theft. Eliminate manual collection of revenue/payments for power.
    Easily increase and reduce the energy tariff price. Can be deployed in
    dual power source or dual tariff scenarios to support diesel generator
    bill. <br /> <br />

    more estates resident’s association, property owners, and facility
    managers are relying on Diesel powered Generators to provide alternative
    energy backup. In some cases, the Grid supply is even less than 6 hours in
    a day and the Generators serves as the main source of power. <br /> <br />
    Unfortunately, the property owner and facility managers cannot easily
    measure the amount electricity consumed from the power generated by the
    Diesel Generating Sets. They rely on estimated billing to cover for the
    monthly expenses. The method is prone to fraud and errors and has resulted
    into untold hardship to both consumers and utility providers. In many
    cases, the consumers lose confidence in the utility provider or the
    utility providers shutdown the business. <br /> <br />
    The present metering convention adopted widely in Nigeria does not support
    dual energy source as most of the properties have single source/single
    tariff electricity meters. Furthermore, most of the meter service provides
    (MSP) and meter access providers (MAP) in Nigeria focus on the single
    energy source metering because their prime customers are the Distribution
    companies (Disco) that buy in mass and are not required by law to provide
    dual metering to their customers. Furthermore, single source meters are
    easier to installed and require less user education to sell and support.
    <br /> <br />
    This vacuum in the Nigeria Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) has opened a
    relative niche market for dual source meters in the private metering
    market, because property owners, estates resident’s association excos and
    facility managers struggle to collect the money spent to power and
    maintain the diesel generators. Similarly, being a utility provider in
    their own rights they also need a self-service platform that will enable
    consumers to pay for power effortless and the money sent to their
    designated bank account. <br /> <br />
    In solving problem, Hacom Energy has integrated dual source meters to its
    vending platform. <br /> <br />
    It enables facility managers, resident associations and utility providers
    to set a separate tariff for Generator and Grid and consumers/residents
    can buy power based on their need. They can also impose a base fee for
    asides from the rates for each source of power. <br /> <br />
    For a consumer to enjoy power from both sources, they must buy tokens and
    load on the meter for each seperate energy source. If tokens are loaded
    onto the Grid (Disco) wallet on the meter, the consumer not have power
    when generator is being used and vice-versa. <br /> <br />`,externalLink:"https://hacomenergy.com/magazine/dual-power-source-dual-tariff-metering/"}];export{r as a};
